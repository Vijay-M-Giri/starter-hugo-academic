### Teaching Assistant

- Nice guy
- Best TA I've ever had
- Honestly such a great TA. He also had many office hours which I know helped many students
- Amazing explanations and examples - thanks a lot!
- He spends his time with you when you didn't understand something. If you needed additional understanding he would explain it in different ways. I never felt "stupid" when trying to learn from him, which makes me comfortable
- He took his time and explained all concepts to me despite the office hour time running out. He patiently waited until I understood the concept.
- visualization of concepts, patience
- Good at explaining things.
